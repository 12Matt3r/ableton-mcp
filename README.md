# AbletonMCP - Ableton Live Model Context Protocol Integration
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@ahujasid/ableton-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@ahujasid/ableton-mcp)

AbletonMCP connects Ableton Live to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Ableton Live. This integration enables prompt-assisted music production, track creation, and Live session manipulation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ableton Live 10 or newer
- Python 3.8 or newer
- [uv package manager](https://astral.sh/uv)

If you're on Mac, please install uv as:
```
brew install uv
```

Otherwise, install from [uv's official website][https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/]

⚠️ Do not proceed before installing UV

### Claude for Desktop Integration

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8)

1. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AbletonMCP": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "ableton-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor Integration

Run ableton-mcp without installing it permanently through uvx. Go to Cursor Settings > MCP and paste this as a command:

```
uvx ableton-mcp
```

⚠️ Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both

### Installing the Ableton Remote Script

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8)

1. Download the `AbletonMCP_Remote_Script/__init__.py` file from this repo

2. Copy the folder to Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory. Different OS and versions have different locations. **One of these should work, you might have to look**:

   **For macOS:**
   - Method 1: Go to Applications > Right-click on Ableton Live app → Show Package Contents → Navigate to:
     `Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/`
   - Method 2: If it's not there in the first method, use the direct path (replace XX with your version number):
     `/Users/[Username]/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live XX/User Remote Scripts`
   
   **For Windows:**
   - Method 1:
     C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Ableton\Live x.x.x\Preferences\User Remote Scripts 
   - Method 2:
     `C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live XX\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\`
   - Method 3:
     `C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live XX\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\`
   *Note: Replace XX with your Ableton version number (e.g., 10, 11, 12)*

4. Create a folder called 'AbletonMCP' in the Remote Scripts directory and paste the downloaded '\_\_init\_\_.py' file

3. Launch Ableton Live

4. Go to Settings/Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI

5. In the Control Surface dropdown, select "AbletonMCP"

6. Set Input and Output to "None"

## Usage

### Starting the Connection

1. Ensure the Ableton Remote Script is loaded in Ableton Live
2. Make sure the MCP server is configured in Claude Desktop or Cursor
3. The connection should be established automatically when you interact with Claude

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the remote script is running in Ableton, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Ableton MCP.
